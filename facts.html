    <H6> Here's some facts about my sweet bull-I mean boy.</H6>
        </div>
        
    <p>Westley previously lived with my parents and another cat called Hashi. 
        Unfortunately he was a bully to Hashi and the stress was making her sick. 
        That's why he came to live with me, there was no one he could bully at my house. 
        But he's got so many good qualities that make him the best pet!</p>
        <ol>
        <li> He has a little white patch on his fluffy chest.</li>
            <li> He enjoys Inaba Churus but he will become a feral beast for catnip flavored Greenies. </li>
            <li> He really really loves a certain type of fabric texture and if not stopped he WILL 
                make weird biscuits in front of your company.</li>
            <li>Thing</li>
