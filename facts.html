    <h1> He a very sweet boy!</h1>
    <H6> Here's some facts about my sweet bull-I mean boy.</H6>
        </div>
        
    <p>Westley previously lived with my parent's friends and another cat called Hashi. 
        Unfortunately he was a bully to Hashi and the stress was making her sick. 
        That's why he came to live with me, there is no one he could bully at my house. 
        But he's got so many good qualities that make him the best pet! Here's some facts about him so that you can decide for yourself.</p>
        <ol>
        <li> He has a little white patch on his fluffy chest.</li>
            <li> He enjoys Inaba Churus but he will become a feral beast for catnip flavored Greenies. </li>
            <li> He really really loves a certain type of fabric texture and if not stopped he WILL 
                make weird biscuits in front of your company.</li>
            <li>He wants to smell everything you have.</li>
            <li>His favorite toy is a little shape sewn from scrap fabric and stuffed with crinkly plastic and a chunk of silvervine.</li>
        </ol>
