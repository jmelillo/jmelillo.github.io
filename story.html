        <p style="text-indent:30px;" >	It was a day like any other, the sun beams on the dog bed were warm, the freeze dried liver treats were tasty, and the behind the ear scritches were simply delightful.  Westly stretched his whole body out like a veteran yoga instructor as he luxuriated in the warmth granted by Helios himself. His girl had left the house in a whirlwind, just barely remembering her purse on the way out. He had only lived with her for a few months, but he quickly discovered that this was in fact a daily occurrence. Still, she gave him treats and she petted his face while brushing him, so he was pretty happy with his human roommate.
       
                 More story, and here is another link to a page on my site
           
                 
        </p>
            <p style="text-indent:30px;">It was then that out of the side of his eye he spotted a small face in the kitchen window. It was Socks, the stray cat who was responsible for delivering messages to the cats in the neighborhood. They had never spoken before, but divine messengers tended to be a solemn bunch. The life of a messenger cat was fraught with danger, and a message could strike them at any time, including in the middle of a precarious situation. It was a life he didn’t envy but just like all cats, he had an immense respect for those who took up the cause. Naturally he didn’t leave him waiting long.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;">He may be what one might call a “mischievous scamp”, but he was still respectful where it counted. He double checked that no one was in the room outside of the old dog sleeping soundly by the desk before jumping from the bench to the table and taking a long leap to the windowsill. He flipped the locks open with his nose and pushed all of his weight on the window in order to speak with Socks.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;">If you looked close enough you could almost see a ghostly glow in the pupils of his misty green eyes and there was an odd reverberation in his voice when Socks addressed him. 
“Westley of the Boulevard of Harvest, I have a message for you from your dear friend from another land.” He said. If not for the respect he had for the other cat, he would have rolled his eyes. The only friend he had who lived far enough away to “be from another land” was Ivanka who lived in Nevada, not Elysium, but he let the messenger continue. “Ivanka of the lane of Mountain View sends you her regards.” he intoned “She asks after your health,” he continues “and requests you help her slay a dragon.” Westley’s head snapped to look as Socks properly “A dragon? Why didn’t you lead with that!” but Socks continued as if he hadn’t heard Westley speak. “She says the skies have gone dark and the wind whips the leaves from the trees. She sees lights flare in the distance at night and worries that the great fire which flows from the dragon’s mouth will spread across the city and eat through the mountains.”
</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;">	Westley stared at Socks in silence, his mouth hanging open in shock. He could hear the wind chimes tinkling merrily in the background as a gentle breeze sent them swaying, completely at odds with the storm raging in Westley’s racing mind as he tried to take in the message. He knew Ivanka wasn’t helpless, her druidic magic was nothing to scoff at, but taking on a dragon was unwise and would likely lead to her untimely demise. Shaking his head he focused back on Socks. “What do I have to do!? How can I help!?” he implored the cat still sitting serenely on the bannister of the deck outside the window.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Socks stood in silence, his eyes flicking back and forth like he was seeing things that weren’t there before suddenly letting out a little chirp, making Westley jump.”First you must consult an elder, then you must recruit the man from Antigua, last you must acquire the Rapier of Florin. Only then can you begin your journey.” Again Westley held back his eye roll. Bruno was his so-called “cousin” who was indeed from Antigua but Socks made him sound mysterious and powerful when he was more like an excitable puppy than anything else.</p>
          <p style="text-indent:30px;">With those final words, Socks bid him farewell in the form of a nod as he hopped off the bannister, pranced down the stairs, and off into the neighborhood surely to pass along his next message. With a sigh Westley pushed the window closed again and leaped off the windowsill. If Ivanka had sent him this message, and his journey included Bruno, this elder simply must be Boomer, the ancient chocolate lab that spent his days laying around the house, his wizarding days well and truly over at this point in his life. He looked to be taking his afternoon snooze as he usually did, head bent at an awkward angle from laying with his head jammed under the deskchair. Westley wove his way through the kitchen table and chairs and stood at the edge of the dining room’s multicolored carpet. He took a deep breath and put one paw in front of the other as he made his way to Boomer and towards the beginning of what would be his biggest adventure yet.</p>
